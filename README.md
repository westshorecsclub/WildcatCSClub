# Wildcat CS Club

Repository for artifacts for helping the CS Club (formerly Cyber Security Club),
now Computer Science Club at Westshore Jr/Sr High School in Melbourne, FL.

# About this project / club #

I've been mentoring this club for 3 years with a few different teachers from
West Shore.  I work in the Cyber Security industry at a local company, and I've
had other peers from my same company and other local companies help mentor
from time to time.

We have been working on teaching / introducing various more advanced topics to
the students than they would normally see in their CS curriculum at a high
school level.  Meetings are after school on Fridays.  Each meeting usually has
a short teaching / lecture segment where we go over some topics, and the rest
of the time is working on a set of challenges as part of a year-long CTF that
I run (keep reading if you are wondering what a CTF is).

## Club Topics

* Historical figures in Software or Hacking
* Linux Operating System
* Using the command line interace / shell
* Computer networking (TCP, UDP, packet capture tools)
* C programming language
* Encryption (caesar cipher, xor, one-time pad, symmetric encryption)
* Computer forensics
* Reverse engineering
* Software exploitation / hacking
* Physical security / lock-picking
* Electronics
* Digital circuits
* Embedded programming (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)

For some topics like software exploitation or lock-picking, we go over the
ethics, laws, responsibilities for using these skills.

## What is CTF?

Cyber Security CTF is a competition where players / teams compete using their computer to find flags
in various challenges related to cyber security.  The flags could be a hidden secret that is hidden
inside a digital picture.  The flag could be from an online game for winning, or if are able
to find a software vulnerability in the game that gives you access to the key through exploitation
of a bug.

CTF is how many cyber security professionals, college students, and even high school students sharpen
their skills.  By creating a game out of learning cyber security subjects, students will be more
willing to engage, increased self-learning, and hopefully having fun.

## Why CTF?

## Sample challenges from prior year CTFs
[Prior year challenges (with sample writeups)](past_challenges) are available. This is only a subset
of the 50 or so challenges the we worked on over the year.

[Slides from this year and prior years](slides/readme.md) are also available.

## Accomplishments / Accolades

West Shore students the past few years have accomplished the following:

* Podium finish for 2023 and 2024 Cyber Quest
* Podium finish for 2023 Code Quest
* $80,000 scholarship for winning CTF at Florida Tech
* Scholarship for reporting a vulnerability to BPS

# Sponsors and Support

Generous support was given to the club from the following organizations.  The kids didn't have to pay for anything out
of pocket.  Sponsors provided loaner laptops, T-shirts for competitions, and [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja) 
discounts and licenses, along with their time.
