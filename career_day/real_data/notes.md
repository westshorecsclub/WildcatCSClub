# Notes about the real data

* Students IDs are just random numbers
* You only get last initial for student privacy
* Feldbush's survey only asked for 6 selections, not the 7 from last years survey
  (hopefully you can easily adjust script for this)
* Students didn't do good job picking sessions, some didn't pick all 6, or
  picked the same 1 twice (I kept there highest priority value)
* There are only 700 students in this list, Feldbush will add more later and we
  will have to rerun our scripts and regenerate schedules later too.  But that
  is easy since we made these cool programs that do all the hard work for us.

*** NEW REQUIREMENT!!! ***

Yeah, bummer, last minute changes are terrible for us SW engineers, but they happen
in real life all the time...

You CANNOT schedule a middle school student in sessions 44, 45, or 46, those are ONLY
for high school students

(Note: I added sessions 45 46 and 47 randomly to the lowest priority slots or missing
priorities, in the hopes that HS grade level students fill them)
