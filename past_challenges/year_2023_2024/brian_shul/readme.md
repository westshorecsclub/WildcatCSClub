## Description:

I wrote a short little biography about Brian Shul.  I hope you enjoy it. It's
honestly completely inadequate, you should watch one of his speeches instead.

But unrelated to the topic of Brian Shul, is privacy.  This challenge is all
about information privacy.

Both of the documents have a flag in it.  You have to be very careful when
publishing and sharing things like word documents.  There have been several very
high-profile information leaks because of poorly redacted documents. Word
documents and media files can have an incredible amount of extra metadata
and hidden information in them.

Look up what a MS Word / Open Office documents really are (the actual
file format.)  Can you take them apart and get extra information out of them?
